# Mini Games
Mini Games is a repository that contains two classic games, Hangman and Rock Paper Scissors, implemented in both Java and Python. The code for these games was developed for a Python Workshop conducted by the CPU Club at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia.

## Games Included
### Hangman
Hangman is a word guessing game where players attempt to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. The game provides a limited number of incorrect guesses before the player loses. 

### Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (a fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended). The game determines the winner based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
